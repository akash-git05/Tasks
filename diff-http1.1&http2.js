// HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol , It is a top level Protocol for the world wide web (www).between
// an end user and the server using computer network through the internet.
// HTTP 1.1:
//  Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989. Its usage is same as the http protocol but it is the 
// new version from that. In this case, a client sends a text fromat request by calling the method 
// GET or POST.server sends a response resource like an HTML page back to the client.
// in addition to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML. 
// all of the resources are returned to the client in the first call for data. 

// HTTP 2:
// HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google for reduce web page load latency 
// by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.All the core concepts found in
//  HTTP 1.1, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, 
//  HTTP/2 modifies how the data is framed and transported between the client and server, both 
//  of which manage the entire process, and hides application complexity within the new framing layer. 
//  As a result, all existing applications can be delivered without modification.
//  as my knowledge these are the thinks are important.
